Dibyanshi26 - Expense Tracker App
Hi!   I'm Dibyanshi and this is a repository for my expense tracker app built with Streamlit.

This app allows you to track your income and expenses in a user-friendly interface. You can:

Add new income and expense transactions
View a history of all your transactions
See a breakdown of your spending by category
The app is currently deployed at: https://dibyanshi26-expense-tracker-app-app-4ttma1.streamlit.app/ 

Tech Stack:

Streamlit
Python
Getting Started

To run the app locally, you'll need to have Python and Streamlit installed. Once you have those, you can clone this repository and run the following command in your terminal:

Bash

streamlit run app.py
This will start the app and open it in your web browser.

Feel free to explore the code and make modifications to fit your needs!

Further Considerations

You can add additional features to the app, such as the ability to export your data to a CSV file or create budgets.
You can improve the user interface by adding charts and graphs to visualize your spending data.
You can deploy the app to a production server so that you can access it from anywhere.
I am always open to suggestions and improvements, so please feel free to create a pull request if you have any ideas!
